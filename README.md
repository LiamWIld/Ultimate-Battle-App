Program: Ultimate Battle Simulation

This project simulates an epic battle between Yoda and Darth Vader using Java multithreading. Each contender performs a repetitive action (representing attacks) in a loop, with randomized delays to simulate rest. 
A shared Water resource ensures that only one contender can hydrate at a time, demonstrating the use of thread synchronization. The first character to complete 200 actions wins.

This assignment focuses on: 
Multithreading, 
Thread synchronization, 
Shared resources

Inputs: No user input is required; all logic is handled internally.

Outputs: Real-time console output showing each contenderâ€™s progress. A final message announcing the winner once a contender reaches 200 actions.
